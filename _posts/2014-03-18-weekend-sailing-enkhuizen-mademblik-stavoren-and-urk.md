Nice weather came, so I've made a decision to do some weekend sailing. While my friend Bogdan was searching for some other crewmembers, I made a boat renting deal with a [Windkracht5](http://www.windkracht5.nl) boat renting company. We ended up 5 total people on [Bavaria 32](http://www.windkracht5.nl/nieuwe-zeilboot-huren-bavaria-32-2.htm).

## Route

During the trip I've used an [iSailor](http://isailor.us) App for route planning and navigating around, specially in the unknown marinas. Her's the final route one can do:

it's around 60 miles round trip.

## Enkhuizen [<i class="fa fa-foursquare"></i>](https://foursquare.com/v/compagnieshaven/4beebc952c082d7f65c53042)

The boat I rented was in a small marina on the side of Enkhuizen, a nice city / village on the Ijsselmeer lake, with the easy access by train (a 1 hour train ride from Amsterdam). I've took the boat at 19, did some single-handed parking practice and started waiting for a crew. The crew was a bit late so after short briefing we decided to go to bed early and leave early in the morning.

We left Enkhuizen at 7 am, did some sailing with different angles to the wind, getting used to the boat and headed towards Mademblik. I also found that 2 crew members were a bit sea sick, so I hoped we'll find some sea-sickness pills on Mademblik.

A nice old city with a beautiful castle. One can observe it while entering the old harbor. Sadly, it was closed inside (. We stopped here for a lunch and managed buying the so-needed pills. After some walking thru the city, the harbormaster gave a tip on Stavoren where to go next.

## Stavoren [<i class="fa fa-foursquare"></i>](https://foursquare.com/v/gemeentehaven-stavoren/4c5722d26418a59323af7e0e)

It was a fast ride here without changing the course; it took us 2 hours of sailing from Mademblik. As we arrived in old harbor, it was starting getting dark. We did a small walk thru the city but almost all the places were closed.

Next day we headed towards Enkhuizen to drop one crewmember there, did some small fix on a boat and headed towards Urk.

A surprisingly beautiful village! Long time ago, when Ijsselmeer was a sea, this village was an island.

We had a nice walk around enjoying the view on the old houses, and after dinner, headed towards Enkhuizen enjoying the beautiful sunset and sailing thru the night.

I hope the crew had a nice time and enjoyed the sailing as much as I did and I hope sailing with them again.
