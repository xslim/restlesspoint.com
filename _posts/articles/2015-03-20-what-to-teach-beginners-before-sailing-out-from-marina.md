Ther's a lot of times I take frends and frends of frends for sailing trips. And most of the times, they are total beginners in sailing. They might red articles on how to pach for the trip (one, two), but it's your responsibility as a Skipper to give them some guidence.

So here are some thoughts:

## Knots
- Fender knot (*XX*) - Beginners need to know how how to tie fenders when you enter the marina. Otherwise you'll need to do a lot of "Fender Over Board" manouvers...
- Cleet knot (*OXO*) - You want to be shore if you will be parking your boat that a new sailor will properly tie that mooring line you gave him
