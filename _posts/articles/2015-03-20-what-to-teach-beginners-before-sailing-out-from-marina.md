There's a lot of times I take friends and friends of frends for sailing trips. Most of the times they are total beginners in sailing and the basics need to be taught on-the-go. They might read an article on how to pack for the trip ([this](http://restlesspoint.com/articles/packing-for-a-weekend-sailing/) or [this](http://restlesspoint.com/articles/packing-for-april-sailing/)), but it's your responsibility as the Skipper to give them guidence and your your ship.

So here's the guide to get them up and running in 30 minutes. 

## Introduction
- _Rolls_ on a Ship: You are a skipper, and they are the crew.
- _Commands_: Everyone is a bit different and "Bring in the rope" might seem short to some. Indicate why its short and the benefit to running a solid ship.
- _Crew_: Know your crew. Ask who can't swim, who will be just looking around and who will help you.

## The Boat 
- _Port_ vs _Starboard_: Start with these terms from the beginning. The easiest saying is "_Do you have any port left?_" to remember that port is the left side. 
- _Fenders_: They fend off problems from expensive boat hull. They come into the boat locker upon leaving the marina. 
- _Cleat_: We fix and release the lines from the cleat, as well as "take lines off" of a cleat. Sometimes we hold the line on a cleat with a tention. Let them know what that is.

## Safety
- _Life Vests_: Show the crew how to put on and properly fit the life vest. 
- _Man Overboard_: If someone falls in the water, this is the proper phrase to shout.
- _Boom_: Everyone should watch out for the boom, especially our tall Dutch crew members.
- _Your fingers_: They can get easily caught between a line and a cleat or a winch and a line. We want everyone to leave with the number of fingers they came with.

## Your Commands
- "_Bring in the ..._": You might say "bring in the line" or "bring in the fender" and clarifying that phrase ahead of time will avoid general confusion. 
- "_Prepare to ..._": "Prepare to release the line". To someone new that means nothing. Tell them how to do it properly. 
- "_Release the ..._": It mean completely let go of the line from its fixed point on shore or another mooring point. 
- "_Fend off the ..._": We say "fend off the boat" if leaving the harbor with a less than perfect result. Tell them how to do it with your hands or a fender.

## Their responses
- "_Clear_": If a rope is released and back in the boat, then the crew member says "clear". 
- "_Ready_": When getting ready to cast off, we need to know that each crew member is ready and need to shout it at the needed time. 

## Rope/Line Basics
- _Line_: Indicate that a line is a rope. Sheet is also. We throw, tie, untie, grab, hold and winch lines, so their key for all crew members. 
- _Check for lines_: Before turning on the engine, we should check for lines. It's an easy task for a crew memeber to do.

## Knots
- _Rolling Hitch_ - Beginners need to know how how to tie fenders when you enter the marina. Otherwise you'll need to do a lot of "Fender Over Board" manuovers...
- _Cleet Hitch_ - You want to be sure if you will be parking your boat that a new sailor will properly tie that mooring line you gave him. **_OXO_** is an easy way to remember. 

## Inside
- _Gas switch_ - Show how to turn it on and stress to turn it off when not in use.
- _Toilet_ - Show how to use it. Stress not to throw stuff in it.
- _Light switches_ - Show where the motoring light switch is
