There's a lot of times I take friends and friends of frends for sailing trips. Most of the times they are total beginners in sailing and the basics need to be taught on-the-go. They might read an article on how to pack for the trip (one, two), but it's your responsibility as the Skipper to give them guidence and your your ship.

So here's the guide to get them up and running in 30 minutes. 

## The Boat
Introduce the needed parts of the boat. 
- Port vs Starboard: Start with these terms from the beginning. The easiest saying is "Do you have any port left?" to remember that port is the left side. 
- Line: Indicate that a line is a rope. We throw, tie, untie, grab, hold and winch lines, so their key for all crew members. 
- Fenders: A car has fenders - okay had - and so does a boat. They fend off problems and will be needed to come into the boat upon leaving the marina. 

## Safety
- Life Vests:
- 
- Watch your hands:

## Commands
- "Bring in"
## Knots
- Fender knot (*XX*) - Beginners need to know how how to tie fenders when you enter the marina. Otherwise you'll need to do a lot of "Fender Over Board" manouvers...
- Cleet knot (*OXO*) - You want to be shore if you will be parking your boat that a new sailor will properly tie that mooring line you gave him
